## Step 4: Resolving an Issue

Once an issue has been addressed or the task is complete, it's time to close it. Closing an issue helps keep your project organized and signals to your team that no further action is needed.

### :white_check_mark: Close the Issue:

- Scroll to the bottom of the issue page.
- You’ll see a button labeled **"Close issue"**.
- Click this button to mark the issue as resolved.

That's it — your issue is now closed and archived! :tada:
