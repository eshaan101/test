## Step 5: Reopening an Issue

Sometimes, an issue might need to be revisited — maybe the problem wasn’t fully resolved, or new information has come up. In these cases, you can easily reopen the issue to resume the discussion and work.

### :repeat: Reopen the Issue:

- Click the issues tab
- Click the Closed tab
- Navigate to the bottom of the closed issue page.
- You’ll see a button labeled **"Reopen issue"**.
- Click this button to reopen the issue and continue tracking progress.

Once reopened, team members can comment, update, or assign the issue as needed. :hammer_and_wrench:
