## Step 2: Collaborating on Issues

Well done creating an issue! :wave:

### What is Collaboration on Issues?

Collaboration on issues is an array of ways for teams to work together, manage, and resolve issues. It involves communication, feedback, and teamwork to track, solve, and complete problems effectively.

### Key Elements of Collaborating on an Issue:

- **Commenting**: Team members can comment on an issue to ask questions, provide feedback, or clarify details.

- **@Mentions**: You can `@mention` team members in comments to notify them and involve them directly in the conversation.

- **Tracking Progress**: Team members can update the status or provide updates, keeping everyone informed about the progress.

### How to Comment on an Issue

1. Open the issue you want to comment on.
2. Scroll down to the comment section at the bottom of the page.
3. Make sure you format your comment to be in between 2 asterisks: `**comment_name**`
4. Type your comment in the text box. You can provide an update such as:  
   `**The task is complete**` or `**Issue resolved, everything is working as expected**`
5. You can also mention a team member in your comment:
   - While writing your comment, type `@` followed by the username of the person you want to mention (e.g., `@username`).
   - This will notify the person, allowing them to respond or take action.
6. Once you’ve written your message, click the **Comment** button to post it.
